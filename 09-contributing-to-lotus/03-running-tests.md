# Running Tests

## Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have completed the steps as outlined in the
Contribution [Getting Started](./02-getting-started.md) guide.

## Running all tests

You can run the entire test suite by executing:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake
```

or:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake test
```

## Running a single test file

You can run a single test file by executing:

```bash
$ ruby -Itest path/to/test/file.rb
```

## Running a single test

This is not as easy as running a single test file. A multitude of solutions
are available in this [StackOverflow answer], and it is left up to your
predilection to decide.
