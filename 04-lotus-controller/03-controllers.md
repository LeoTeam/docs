# Controllers

A Controller is nothing more than a logical grouping of actions: just a Ruby
module. This is sometimes preferable to write for conciseness.

```ruby
module Articles
  class Index
    include Lotus::Action

    # ...
  end

  class Show
    include Lotus::Action

    # ...
  end
end
```
