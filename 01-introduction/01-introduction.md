# Introduction

## What is Lotus?

Lotus is a Ruby MVC web framework comprised of many micro-libraries. It has a
simple, stable API, a minimal DSL, and prioritises the use of plain objects over
magical, over-complicated classes with too much responsibility.

The natural repercussion of using simple objects with clear responsibilities
is more boilerplate code. Lotus provides ways to mitigate
this extra legwork while keeping the underlying implementation the same.

## Why Choose Lotus?

Here are three compelling reasons to choose Lotus:

### Lotus is Lightweight

Lotus's code is relatively short. It only concerns itself with the things
that all web applications&mdash;regardless of implementation&mdash;need.

Lotus ships with several optional modules that can be included if required.
Other libraries that extend functionality can also be included easily.

### Lotus is Architecturally Sound

If you've ever felt like you're stretching against the 'Rails way', or found
it difficult to write tests for your Sinatra routes, you'll appreciate Lotus.

Lotus keeps controller actions class-based, making them easier to test in isolation.

Lotus also encourages you to write your application logic in use case or
workflow objects, and views are separated from templates so the logic inside
of them can be well-contained and tested in isolation.

### Lotus is Threadsafe

Making use of green threads is a great way to boost the performance of your
application. It shouldn't be hard to write thread-safe code, and Lotus (when
using the entire framework, or using only parts of it) is runtime threadsafe.
