# Generating a New Application


## Assumptions

This guide assumes you are already familiar with Ruby and have fulfilled
Lotus's [requirements](03-requirements.md).


## Generating a Skeleton Application

To generate an application, run

```bash
$ lotus new my_app
```

where `my_app` is what you'd like to name your application.

It's possible to pass some options to the generator to customize the
application it creates. You can see these options by
running

```bash
$ lotus new --help
```
