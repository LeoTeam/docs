# Requirements

Lotus's only requirement is to have Ruby 2.x installed. If you do not have Ruby
installed, please visit [ruby-lang.org](http://ruby-lang.org) for installation
instructions.

You can check whether Ruby is installed by running a simple command in your
terminal or console:

```bash
$ ruby -v
ruby-2.1.2-p95
```

If the command does not tell you some variant of `ruby: command not found`, then
Ruby is installed!
