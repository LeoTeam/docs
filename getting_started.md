Installing Lotus
--------------------------
To run Lotus you will need to have Ruby installed, open up a command line prompt
and check to see wether you have it installed:

```bash
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p353
```

If you don't have Ruby installed look at [ruby-lang.org](http://ruby-lang.org)
for an installation guide.

Now you are in a position to install Lotus. To install through Bundler add the
line below to your Gemfile:

```bash
$ gem 'lotusrb'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

To install locally, run:

```bash
$ gem install lotusrb
```
